Please take the time to read this first message, you can skip all future tutorials at any time by clicking the button at the bottom of the scroll bar. You will playout a civilization through the ages starting in pre-history. You must complete quests, craft items, build and have colonists to reach new ages and unlocking new technologies on the way! \r\n\r\n Some basic things to get you started: \r\n    * Quests are part of this mod. You can find the button to access them in the Colony tab. \r\n    * The Stockpile has been decentralized. You must have crates and porters to transport things! \r\n    * The first thing you should do is place your stockpile block. \r\n    * You can right click on berry bushes to manually harvest berries. \r\n ",

Porters like your storage will get more advanced through the ages of your civilization. They will start off slow and not be able to carry a lot of items.
