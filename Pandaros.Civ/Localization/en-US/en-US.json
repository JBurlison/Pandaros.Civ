Plese take the time to read this first message, you can stip all future tutorials at any time by clicking the button at the bottom of the scroll bar. You will playout a civilization through the ages starting in pre-history. You must complete quests, craft items, build and have colonists to reach new ages and unlocking new technologies on the way! \r\n\r\n Some basic things to get you started: \r\n    * Quests are part of this mod. You can find the button to access them in the Colony tab. \r\n    * The Stockpile has been decentralized. You must have crates and porters to transport things! \r\n    * The first thing you should do is place your stockpile block. \r\n \r\n ",

Stockpile upgrade blocks must be placed in the stockpile area. Each stockpile upgrade block gives specific upgrades to you items max stack size within the stockpile. The stockpile area increases in size as you progress through each age. Storage upgrade block tooltips provide information on the upgrades. You MUST have a route available for colonists to access the stockpile block directly. \r\n",

Additionally unlike your stockpile, crates can only hold a specific amount of unique items on top of having max stack sizes. If a crafter cannot load items into a crate, they will bring them to the stockpile block. Right clicking on a crate with a empty hand will allow you to manage that crates inventory. \r\n",

A porter to bring items to crates for crafters and a porter to take items from gatherers and crafters to the stockpile. Porters like your storage will get more advanced through the ages of your civilization. They will start off slow and not be able to carry a lot of items. (about one crate full) so it will be important to upgrade your porters as your civilization progresses. \r\n"
